## Usage

`ciscospark` has three basic modes of operation:

- [As a shell script](#shell-script-quick-start)
- [On a nodejs server](#nodejs)
- [In a web browser](#browser)

### Shell Script (Quick Start)

This is the quickest way to get up and running with our JavaScript SDK. Simply set the environment variable `CISCOSPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your access token and add the following line at the top of your JavaScript file to get a ready-to-use instance.

> You can get your `CISCOSPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the [developer portal](https://developer.ciscospark.com).

```js
const ciscospark = require(`ciscospark/env`);
```
